### Advanced String Methods

The string method lower will return the string with all characters changed to lowercase. The inverse of this is the upper method, which will return the string all in uppercase. Just like with previous methods, we call these on a string using dot notation, like "this is a string".upper(). This would return the string "THIS IS A STRING". This can be super handy when checking user input, since someone might type in all lowercase, all uppercase, or even a mixture of cases.

You can use the strip method to remove surrounding whitespace from a string. Whitespace includes spaces, tabs, and newline characters. You can also use the methods  lstrip and rstrip to remove whitespace only from the left or the right side of the string, respectively.

The method count can be used to return the number of times a substring appears in a string. This can be handy for finding out how many characters appear in a string, or counting the number of times a certain word appears in a sentence or paragraph.

If you wanted to check if a string ends with a given substring, you can use the method endswith. This will return True if the substring is found at the end of the string, and False if not.

The isnumeric method can check if a string is composed of only numbers. If the string contains only numbers, this method will return True. We can use this to check if a string contains numbers before passing the string to the int() function to convert it to an integer, avoiding an error. Useful!

We took a look at string concatenation using the plus sign, earlier. We can also use the join method to concatenate strings. This method is called on a string that will be used to join a list of strings. The method takes a list of strings to be joined as a parameter, and returns a new string composed of each of the strings from our list joined using the initial string. For example, " ".join(["This","is","a","sentence"]) would return the string "This is a sentence".

The inverse of the join method is the split method. This allows us to split a string into a list of strings. By default, it splits by any whitespace characters. You can also split by any other characters by passing a parameter.


#### Fill in the gaps in the initials function so that it returns the initials of the words contained in the phrase received, in upper case. For example: "Universal Serial Bus" should return "USB"; "local area network" should return "LAN”.

def initials(phrase):
    words = phrase.upper().split()
    result = ""
    for word in words:
        result += word[0]
    return result

print(initials("Universal Serial Bus")) # Should be: USB
print(initials("local area network")) # Should be: LAN
print(initials("Operating system")) # Should be: OS

### Formatting Strings

Modify the student_grade function using the format method, so that it returns the phrase "X received Y% on the exam". For example, student_grade("Reed", 80) should return "Reed received 80% on the exam".

def student_grade(name, grade):
	return "{} received {}% on the exam".format(name,grade)

print(student_grade("Reed", 80))
print(student_grade("Paige", 92))
print(student_grade("Jesse", 85))

### String Formatting

You can use the format method on strings to concatenate and format strings in all kinds of powerful ways. To do this, create a string containing curly brackets, {}, as a placeholder, to be replaced. Then call the format method on the string using .format() and pass variables as parameters. The variables passed to the method will then be used to replace the curly bracket placeholders. This method automatically handles any conversion between data types for us. 

If the curly brackets are empty, they’ll be populated with the variables passed in the order in which they're passed. However, you can put certain expressions inside the curly brackets to do even more powerful string formatting operations. You can put the name of a variable into the curly brackets, then use the names in the parameters. This allows for more easily readable code, and for more flexibility with the order of variables.

You can also put a formatting expression inside the curly brackets, which lets you alter the way the string is formatted. For example, the formatting expression {:.2f} means that you’d format this as a float number, with two digits after the decimal dot. The colon acts as a separator from the field name, if you had specified one. You can also specify text alignment using the greater than operator: >. For example, the expression {:>3.2f} would align the text three spaces to the right, as well as specify a float number with two decimal places. String formatting can be very handy for outputting easy-to-read textual output.

### String Reference Cheat Sheet

String operations

len(string) Returns the length of the string
for character in string Iterates over each character in the string
if substring in string Checks whether the substring is part of the string
string[i] Accesses the character at index i of the string, starting at zero
string[i:j] Accesses the substring starting at index i, ending at index j-1. If i is omitted, it's 0 by default. If j is omitted, it's len(string) by default.

String methods
string.lower() / string.upper() Returns a copy of the string with all lower / upper case characters
string.lstrip() / string.rstrip() / string.strip() Returns a copy of the string without left / right / left or right whitespace
string.count(substring) Returns the number of times substring is present in the string
string.isnumeric() Returns True if there are only numeric characters in the string. If not, returns False.
string.isalpha() Returns True if there are only alphabetic characters in the string. If not, returns False.
string.split() / string.split(delimiter) Returns a list of substrings that were separated by whitespace / delimiter
string.replace(old, new) Returns a new string where all occurrences of old have been replaced by new.
delimiter.join(list of strings) Returns a new string with all the strings joined by the delimiter 


### Formatting Strings Cheat Sheet

#### Using the format() method

The format method returns a copy of the string where the {} placeholders have been replaced with the values of the variables. These variables are converted to strings if they weren't strings already. Empty placeholders are replaced by the variables passed to format in the same order.

# "base string with {} placeholders".format(variables)

example = "format() method"

formatted_string = "this is an example of using the {} on a string".format(example)

print(formatted_string)

"""Outputs:
this is an example of using the format() method on a string
"""

If the placeholders indicate a number, they’re replaced by the variable corresponding to that order (starting at zero).

# "{0} {1}".format(first, second)

first = "apple"
second = "banana"
third = "carrot"

formatted_string = "{0} {2} {1}".format(first, second, third)

print(formatted_string)

"""Outputs:
apple carrot banana
"""


If the placeholders indicate a field name, they’re replaced by the variable corresponding to that field name. This means that parameters to format need to be passed indicating the field name.

# "{var1} {var2}".format(var1=value1, var2=value2)

"{:exp1} {:exp2}".format(value1, value2)
If the placeholders include a colon, what comes after the colon is a formatting expression. See below for the expression reference.
# {:d} integer value
'{:d}'.format(10.5) → '10'

Formatting expressions

Expr    |  Meaning                                    | Example

{:d}    | integer value                               | '{:d}'.format(10.5) → '10'

{:.2f}  | floating point with that many decimals      |  '{:.2f}'.format(0.5) → '0.50'

{:.2s}  | string with that many characters            |  '{:.2s}'.format('Python') → 'Py'

{:<6s}  | string aligned to the left that many spaces | '{:<6s}'.format('Py') → 'Py    '

{:>6s}  | string aligned to the right that many spaces| '{:>6s}'.format('Py') → '    Py'

{:^6s}  | string centered in that many spaces         |'{:^6s}'.format('Py') → '  Py  '


#### Old string formatting

The format() method was introduced in Python 2.6. Before that, the % (modulo) operator could be used to get a similar result. While this method is no longer recommended for new code, you might come across it in someone else's code. This is what it looks like:

"base string with %s placeholder" % variable

The % (modulo) operator returns a copy of the string where the placeholders indicated by %  followed by a formatting expression are replaced by the variables after the operator.

 "base string with %d and %d placeholders" % (value1, value2)

To replace more than one value, the values need to be written between parentheses. The formatting expression needs to match the value type.

 

"%(var1) %(var2)" % {var1:value1, var2:value2}

Variables can be replaced by name using a dictionary syntax (we’ll learn about dictionaries in an upcoming video).

 

"Item: %s - Amount: %d - Price: %.2f" % (item, amount, price)

The formatting expressions are mostly the same as those of the format() method. 

Check out the official documentation for old string formatting.






#### Formatted string literals (Optional)

This feature was added in Python 3.6 and isn’t used a lot yet. Again, it's included here in case you run into it in the future, but it's not needed for this or any upcoming courses.

A formatted string literal or f-string is a string that starts with 'f' or 'F' before the quotes. These strings might contain {} placeholders using expressions like the ones used for format method strings.

The important difference with the format method is that it takes the value of the variables from the current context, instead of taking the values from parameters.

 Examples:

>>> name = "Micah"

>>> print(f'Hello {name}')

Hello Micah

 

>>> item = "Purple Cup"

>>> amount = 5

>>> price = amount * 3.25

>>> print(f'Item: {item} - Amount: {amount} - Price: {price:.2f}')

Item: Purple Cup - Amount: 5 - Price: 16.25


### Strings Practice

Question 1
The is_palindrome function checks if a string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that can be equally read from left to right or right to left, omitting blank spaces, and ignoring capitalization. Examples of palindromes are words like kayak and radar, and phrases like "Never Odd or Even". Fill in the blanks in this function to return True if the passed string is a palindrome, False if not.

def is_palindrome(input_string):
	# We'll create two strings, to compare them
	new_string = ""
	reverse_string = ""
	# Traverse through each letter of the input string
	for letter in input_string:
		# Add any non-blank letters to the 
		# end of one string, and to the front
		# of the other string. 
		if letter != " ":
			new_string += letter.lower()
			reverse_string = letter.lower() + reverse_string
	# Compare the strings
	if new_string == reverse_string:
		return True
	return False

print(is_palindrome("Never Odd or Even")) # Should be True
print(is_palindrome("abc")) # Should be False
print(is_palindrome("kayak")) # Should be True

Question 2
Using the format method, fill in the gaps in the convert_distance function so that it returns the phrase "X miles equals Y km", with Y having only 1 decimal place. For example, convert_distance(12) should return "12 miles equals 19.2 km".

def convert_distance(miles):
	km = miles * 1.6
	result = "{} miles equals {:.1f} km".format(miles,km)
	return result

print(convert_distance(12)) # Should be: 12 miles equals 19.2 km
print(convert_distance(5.5)) # Should be: 5.5 miles equals 8.8 km
print(convert_distance(11)) # Should be: 11 miles equals 17.6 km

Question3
Fill in the gaps in the nametag function so that it uses the format method to return first_name and the first initial of last_name followed by a period. For example, nametag("Jane", "Smith") should return "Jane S."

def nametag(first_name, last_name):
	return("{} {:.1s}.".format(first_name, last_name))

print(nametag("Jane", "Smith")) 
# Should display "Jane S." 
print(nametag("Francesco", "Rinaldi")) 
# Should display "Francesco R." 
print(nametag("Jean-Luc", "Grand-Pierre")) 
# Should display "Jean-Luc G." 


Question 4
The replace_ending function replaces the old string in a sentence with the new string, but only if the sentence ends with the old string. If there is more than one occurrence of the old string in the sentence, only the one at the end is replaced, not all of them. For example, replace_ending("abcabc", "abc", "xyz") should return abcxyz, not xyzxyz or xyzabc. The string comparison is case-sensitive, so replace_ending("abcabc", "ABC", "xyz") should return abcabc (no changes made). 

def replace_ending(sentence, old, new):
	# Check if the old string is at the end of the sentence 
	if sentence.split()[-1] == old: # OR if sentence[-len(old):]
		# Using i as the slicing index, combine the part
		# of the sentence up to the matched string at the 
		# end with the new string
		i = len(old)
		new_sentence = sentence[:-i]+new
		return new_sentence

	# Return the original sentence if there is no match 
	return sentence
	
print(replace_ending("It's raining cats and cats", "cats", "dogs")) 
# Should display "It's raining cats and dogs"
print(replace_ending("She sells seashells by the seashore", "seashells", "donuts")) 
# Should display "She sells seashells by the seashore"
print(replace_ending("The weather is nice in May", "may", "april")) 
# Should display "The weather is nice in May"
print(replace_ending("The weather is nice in May", "May", "April")) 
# Should display "The weather is nice in April"




Practice Quiz: Lists


1.
Question 1
Given a list of filenames, we want to rename all the files with extension hpp to the extension h. To do this, we would like to generate a new list called newfilenames, consisting of the new filenames. Fill in the blanks in the code using any of the methods you’ve learned thus far, like a for loop or a list comprehension.

filenames = ["program.c", "stdio.hpp", "sample.hpp", "a.out", "math.hpp", "hpp.out"]
# Generate newfilenames as a list containing the new filenames
# using as many lines of code as your chosen method requires.
newfilenames = []

for filen in filenames:
    
    if filen.endswith("hpp"):
        newfilenames.append(filen.replace("hpp","h"))
    else:
        newfilenames.append(filen)


print(newfilenames) 
# Should be ["program.c", "stdio.h", "sample.h", "a.out", "math.h", "hpp.out"]

2.
Question 2
Let's create a function that turns text into pig latin: a simple text transformation that modifies each word moving the first character to the end and appending "ay" to the end. For example, python ends up as ythonpay.

def pig_latin(text):
  say = []
  # Separate the text into words
  words = text.split()
  for word in words:
    # Create the pig latin word and add it to the list
    new = word[1:] + word[0] + "ay"
    say.append(new)
    # Turn the list back into a phrase
  return " ".join(say)
		
print(pig_latin("hello how are you")) # Should be "ellohay owhay reaay ouyay"
print(pig_latin("programming in python is fun")) # Should be "rogrammingpay niay ythonpay siay unfay"

The permissions of a file in a Linux system are split into three sets of three permissions: read, write, and execute for the owner, group, and others. Each of the three values can be expressed as an octal number summing each permission, with 4 corresponding to read, 2 to write, and 1 to execute. Or it can be written with a string using the letters r, w, and x or - when the permission is not granted.
 For example: 
 640 is read/write for the owner, read for the group, and no permissions for the others; converted to a string, it would be: "rw-r-----"
 755 is read/write/execute for the owner, and read/execute for group and others; converted to a string, it would be: "rwxr-xr-x"
 Fill in the blanks to make the code convert a permission in octal format into a string format.
 
 def octal_to_string(octal):
    result = ""
    value_letters = [(4,"r"),(2,"w"),(1,"x")]
    # Iterate over each of the digits in octal
    for digit in [int(n) for n in str(octal)]:
        # Check for each of the permissions values
        for value, letter in value_letters:
            if digit >= value:
                result += letter
                digit -= value
            else:
                result += "-"
    return result
    
print(octal_to_string(755)) # Should be rwxr-xr-x
print(octal_to_string(644)) # Should be rw-r--r--
print(octal_to_string(750)) # Should be rwxr-x---
print(octal_to_string(600)) # Should be rw-------

Question 5
The group_list function accepts a group name and a list of members, and returns a string with the format: group_name: member1, member2, … For example, group_list("g", ["a","b","c"]) returns "g: a, b, c". Fill in the gaps in this function to do that.

def group_list(group, users):
  members = ", ".join(users)
  return "{}: {}".format(group, members)

print(group_list("Marketing", ["Mike", "Karen", "Jake", "Tasha"])) # Should be "Marketing: Mike, Karen, Jake, Tasha"
print(group_list("Engineering", ["Kim", "Jay", "Tom"])) # Should be "Engineering: Kim, Jay, Tom"
print(group_list("Users", "")) # Should be "Users:"


6.
Question 6
The guest_list function reads in a list of tuples with the name, age, and profession of each party guest, and prints the sentence "Guest is X years old and works as __." for each one. For example, guest_list(('Ken', 30, "Chef"), ("Pat", 35, 'Lawyer'), ('Amanda', 25, "Engineer")) should print out: Ken is 30 years old and works as Chef. Pat is 35 years old and works as Lawyer. Amanda is 25 years old and works as Engineer. Fill in the gaps in this function to do that. 

def guest_list(guests):
	for name, age, prof in guests:
		print("{} is {} years old and works as {}".format(name, age, prof))

guest_list([('Ken', 30, "Chef"), ("Pat", 35, 'Lawyer'), ('Amanda', 25, "Engineer")])

#Click Run to submit code

Module 4 Graded Assessment

1.
Question 1

The format_address function separates out parts of the address string into new strings: house_number and street_name, and returns: "house number X on street named Y". The format of the input string is: numeric house number, followed by the street name which may contain numbers, but never by themselves, and could be several words long. For example, "123 Main Street", "1001 1st Ave", or "55 North Center Drive". Fill in the gaps to complete this function.

def format_address(address_string):
  # Declare variables
  house_number = ""
  street_name = []

  address = address_string.split()

  # Traverse through the address parts
  for item in address:
    # Determine if the address part is the
    # house number or part of the street name
    if item.isnumeric() == True:
  # Does anything else need to be done 
  # before returning the result?
      house_number = item
    else:
      street_name.append(item)
      
  # Return the formatted string  
  return "house number {} on street named {}".format(house_number," ".join(street_name))

Question 3
A professor with two assistants, Jamie and Drew, wants an attendance list of the students, in the order that they arrived in the classroom. Drew was the first one to note which students arrived, and then Jamie took over. After the class, they each entered their lists into the computer and emailed them to the professor, who needs to combine them into one, in the order of each student's arrival. Jamie emailed a follow-up, saying that her list is in reverse order. Complete the steps to combine them into one list as follows: the contents of Drew's list, followed by Jamie's list in reverse order, to get an accurate list of the students as they arrived.

def combine_lists(list1, list2):
  # Generate a new list containing the elements of list2
  # Followed by the elements of list1 in reverse order
  return list2 + list1[::-1]

Question 6
Taylor and Rory are hosting a party. They sent out invitations, and each one collected responses into dictionaries, with names of their friends and how many guests each friend is bringing. Each dictionary is a partial list, but Rory's list has more current information about the number of guests. Fill in the blanks to combine both dictionaries into one, with each friend listed only once, and the number of guests from Rory's dictionary taking precedence, if a name is included in both dictionaries. Then print the resulting dictionary.

Question 7
Use a dictionary to count the frequency of letters in the input string. Only letters should be counted, not blank spaces, numbers, or punctuation. Upper case should be considered the same as lower case. For example, count_letters("This is a sentence.") should return {'t': 2, 'h': 1, 'i': 2, 's': 3, 'a': 1, 'e': 3, 'n': 2, 'c': 1}.

def count_letters(text):

  # Go through each letter in the text
  for letter in lower_text:
    # Check if the letter needs to be counted or not
    if letter.isalpha():
    # Add or increment the value in the dictionary
      count = lower_text.count(letter)
      result[letter] = count
  return result

print(count_letters("AaBbCc"))
# Should be {'a': 2, 'b': 2, 'c': 2}

print(count_letters("Math is fun! 2+2=4"))
# Should be {'m': 1, 'a': 1, 't': 1, 'h': 1, 'i': 1, 's': 1, 'f': 1, 'u': 1, 'n': 1}

print(count_letters("This is a sentence."))
